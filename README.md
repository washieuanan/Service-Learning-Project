# Service-Learning-Project

This project was created for a project within my High School Biology Class. My project utilizes an NYC OpenData dataset to analyze recycling trends within New York City. The aim of my project was to utilize the data and graphs generated to inform my school about ways to improve their recycling habits. I utilized many Python libraries (including Pandas, NumPy, and MatPlotLib to read my data, edit my data, and graph my data. If you have any questions about this project, you may email me at wanan@browning.edu.
